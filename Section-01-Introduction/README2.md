---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed on your system (Windows / macOS / Linux)
- Basic familiarity with the command line / terminal

---

## Files / Project structure (recommended)

```
myproject/
├─ .venv/                 # virtual environment (ignored in VCS)
├─ requirements.txt       # pinned dependencies (example below)
├─ README.md
├─ src/
│  ├─ __init__.py
│  ├─ run.py              # entry point
│  └─ sum.py              # example module
└─ tests/
   └─ test_sum.py
```

---

## Dependencies (example)

Put pinned versions in `requirements.txt` so installs are reproducible:

```
requests==2.31.0
flask==3.0.0
```

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Virtual environment (why & how)

**Why**: keeps project dependencies isolated so different projects can use different package versions safely.

**Traditional / simple (venv)**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv         # create venv named .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows (PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1)
which python                  # should point to .venv python
which pip                     # should point to .venv pip
```

To exit the venv:

```bash
deactivate
```

**Other modern tools**: `pipx`, `pipenv`, `poetry`, and `pyenv` are popular for managing environments and packaging. Use them if you want extra features (dependency resolution, publishing, multi-Python versions).

## How to organize Python code (guidelines)

- Use clear module names and keep small functions focused on one task.
- Project modules in `src/` or a package directory.
- `__init__.py` marks a package (can be empty or expose public API).
- Keep utility helpers in a `utils/` or `packages/` folder.

Example small module layout:

```
src/
  run.py      # app entry
  calculator/
    __init__.py
    arithmetic.py
```

**Class note:** classes have their own state and methods. Prefer encapsulation — don't access another class's internal attributes directly; use methods or properties.

---

## Code — small example (cleaned)

Here's your original snippet, cleaned and annotated.

```python
# src/run.py
import sys

print(sys.version)
print("hello world")  # corrected spelling from "hallo"
```

### Explanation

- `import sys` brings in system-specific parameters and functions.
- `sys.version` prints the currently running Python version string.
- `print("hello world")` prints a short greeting.

### Sample output (example)

Run the file:

```bash
python src/run.py
```

Possible output:

```
3.11.4 (main, Jul  2 2024, 18:20:11) [GCC 12.2.0]
hello world
```

> Note: the exact `sys.version` string will depend on the Python build and OS.

---

## Practical examples & samples

### 1) Reading requirements & installing (no input)

**Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
**Expected console output**: pip will download and install packages listed.

### 2) Small function example `sum.py` and testable sample

```python
# src/sum.py
def add(a, b):
    """Return sum of two numbers (int or float)."""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add(2, 3))  # example run
```

**Sample run & output**:

```bash
python src/sum.py
# output:
5
```

## PEP8 & The Zen of Python

### PEP8 (short)

- Use 4 spaces per indent (no tabs).
- Choose meaningful variable names.
- Use linters/formatters (e.g., `flake8`, `black`, `isort`) to keep code consistent.

### The Zen of Python (brief)

Run `import this` for the canonical list, but the core ideas are:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Readability counts.

(These are guidelines — pragmatic exceptions are fine when justified.)

---

## Edge cases & common bugs

- Typos in strings (`hallo` → `hello`) can be confusing; keep consistent spelling.
- Forgetting to activate the virtual environment leads to installing packages globally.
- Hard-coded paths can break cross-OS portability — use `pathlib.Path`.
- Using mutable default arguments — avoid `def f(a, l=[]):` patterns.

---

## Testing & quick checks

- Start with runnable `if __name__ == "__main__":` examples for quick local testing.
- Write small unit tests in `tests/` and run with `pytest`.
- Use `which python` / `where python` to confirm the active interpreter in your shell.

---

## Complexity / Performance (note)

The example code here is trivial (O(1) time for prints and simple arithmetic). For real apps, profile hotspots using `cProfile` or line profilers.

---

## Short summary

This document turns your rough notes into an actionable, beginner-friendly guide: how to set up a virtual environment, pin and install dependencies, structure code, follow PEP8, and run simple scripts with sample I/O. Keep experimenting — the more you write, the clearer the patterns become. 🚀
