in python all thing are object 

- what is object ? and what is OOP?
in real world project creat help of OOP in place of prosediral programing (its genaral mens we use python data types )
but OOP give power to creat our own data types thats help us to do the job 
example : os we can do hacking in winodw mac but kali linux give us more feture so we use that 

OOP we can crests own data types
in today world what ever application we creat its use OOP

OOP have 
 - object 
 - class 
 this 4 are main 
 - polymorphism 
 - encapsulation 
 - inhertance 
 - abstruction

# class and object 
all data types are actucaly built in classes . and when we creat varibles of that class python called that variable is object 
mens list is class but L = [1,2,3] L is object. 
class is a blue print 
every class have its own set of function 
 like list have diffrent fucntion and tupple have diffrent function

class 
 i. data or property 
 ii.  function behaviour 
when we creat class we give data or function 

object is instence of class
