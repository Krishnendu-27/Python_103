What are Lists?
List is a data type where you can store multiple items under 1 name. More technically, lists act like dynamic arrays which means you can add more items on the fly. its dynamic 
[list example](./Pasted_image.png)
L = [20 , "jes " , 56.22 , [30,60,50]]
Array Vs Lists
Fixed Vs Dynamic Size
Convenience -> Hetrogeneous
Speed of Execution
Memory
when we store array we alocated in continues memory in binary format 

so in python list store in contines way but only the adress 

mens if [1,2,3] then 
1 store in 500 location 
2 store in 690 location 
3 store in 420 location 
and 3 scope created and it store 500,690,420 
its called *Refrencial Array*
so python creat a list first acording the input then we we need to enter more value python creat a list internally and coppy all value that we input previously + add new value it contines that why its a dynamic array
Characterstics of a List
Ordered
Changeble/Mutable
Hetrogeneous
Can have duplicates
are dynamic
can be nested
items can be accessed
can contain any kind of objects in python
